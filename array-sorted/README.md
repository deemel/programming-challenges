Given an array of size n, write a program to check if it is sorted in ascending order or not. Equal values are allowed in array and two consecutive equal values are considered sorted.

Examples:

Input: [20, 21, 45, 89, 89, 90]
Output: true

Input: [20, 20, 45, 89, 89, 90]
Output: true

Input: [20, 20, 78, 98, 99, 97]
Output: false
