# programming-challenges
Collection of solutions to programming challenges written in languages such as Java, Python.
- add-strings (Java): Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as string, return the sum of num1 and num2.
- array-sorted (Java): Given an array of size n, write a program to check if it is sorted in ascending order or not.
- binary-consecutive-ones (Java): Return true if binary representation of integer contains consecutives 1s, else return false.
- counting-cycle (Java): Each element of an int array points to the another element, eventually creating a cycle. Starting at array[0], find the length of the cycle.
- letter-combinations-phone-number (Java): Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent.
- median-sorted-arrays (Java): There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively. Find the median of the two sorted arrays.
- ransom-note (Python): Given an arbitrary ransom note string and another string containing letters from all the magazines, write a function that will return true if the ransom note can be constructed from the magazines; otherwise, it will return false.
- reverse-string (Java): Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed.
- rock-paper-scissors (Python): Rock paper scissors simulation.
- skyline (Java): A city's skyline is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that city when viewed from a distance. Now suppose you are given the locations and height of all the buildings as shown on a cityscape photo, write a program to output the skyline formed by these buildings collectively.
- transpose-file (Shell): Given a text file file.txt, transpose its content.
- trapping-rain-water (Java): Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.
- two-sum (Java, Python): Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
- valid-parentheses (Java): Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
